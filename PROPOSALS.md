# 🎮 Game Design Document — Zelda-Inspired JS Game
### 📌 Overview

The player is mysteriously pulled into an magical game world — a dangerous jungle realm where mythical creatures and ancient spirits guard the secrets of escape. To return home, the player must overcome environmental challenges in each region (hot and cold regions, each with unique enemies, hazardsand survive); defeat the creatures and region guardians and collect the sacred keys in order to unlock the Final Gate and break free from the jungle world.

Every step brings the player one step closer to freedom, but the game world becomes more dangerous with each region conquered.
