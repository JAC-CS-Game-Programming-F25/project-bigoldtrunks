# 🎮 MystiaJungle
## 📌 Overview
The game draws strong inspiration from the survival-adventure spirit of Jumanji storyline, with the  where characters are trapped into a dangerous, unpredictable game world filled with escalating challenges. Similarly, this game places the player inside a magical game world where they get stuck into. it is a big jungle realm they must escape by overcoming trials, defeating creatures. To return to reality, the player must conquer different regions (Scorching wilds - hot region; Frozen Platau - cold region) to find the sacred key, which is the only way to unlock the final gate

## Requirements
### Control scheme: 

- Player moves using W/A/S/D keys
- Player hit spaceBar to start a Sword swinging
- If player can gain ability as they progress deeper in the region and collect the crystal item; hit J (first ability) or K (second ability)
- Player starts playing after the FallingDownToEarthState, meaning they just get pulled to this mysterial game world. 
- Player has 3-lives, meaning they can be dead and revive, the FallingDownToEarthState comes in to play again. 
- If Player dead and have no lives left, they lose and game over.
- Player can discover the map to find our the mini boss to get the key so he can progress to another regions, and finally meet the big boss.
- Player escape the game world once they are holding the key enter the escape gate.
- Player can kill creatures and big boss with his abilities.
- His initial ability can be good for easy creatures, but can be not efficient or not sufficient for later regions and the big boss as it can take long or harder. 
Futher development:
+ Since we have the time limit, if the time runs out and he still unable to get the key they he also lose. (nice-to-have)
+ Player can break the barrier, remove object like tree etc, to make his way faster to find the key.
